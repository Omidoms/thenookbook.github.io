                    <h2>Why The Nook Books?</h2>
                    <p><i>
                        One of the many reasons to pick The Nook Books is because we help support the local community in Eastern
                        North Carolina by finding books that have been discarded from local public libraries, thrift stores, and 
                        other donation centers. Furthermore, our books are marked down at a price that can be found anywhere else.</i></p>

                <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
                <p><i>
                    Our mission statement is simply "Books for All". This simple statement shows how much we believe in equal
                    distribution and dispersement of books that have been found in Eastern North Carolina. We believe that every
                    book has a home and homeowner waiting for them.</i></p>

                <h2>Business Outlook</h2>
                <p><i>As of now, we are currently looking to expand the amount of books that are available for purchase each week
                    on the website. Also, we are looking to expand to include other accessories that go along with our products such
                    as bookmarks or customizable book covers for certain books.
